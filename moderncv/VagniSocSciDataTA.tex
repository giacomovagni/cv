I am writing to apply for the two following courses: “Foundations of Social Data Science” and “Applied Analytical Statistics”. 

I am a fourth year DPhil student in Sociology. I am eager to get more teaching experience this year. I have a lot of experience in manipulating data and performing statistical computation, mainly using \texttt{R}. However, I followed a course on \texttt{Python} some years ago and I understand the basics of the \texttt{Numpy} and \texttt{Panda} syntax, which is fairly similar to \texttt{R} now. 

My greatest strength is my experience working with data. I have a good knowledge on how to process and prepare data for statistical computing. For instance, I am familiar with Multiple Imputations or Preprocessing via Matching. I developed a statistical interest in Sequence Analysis (dissimilarity distances, e.g. Optimal Matching) and in Clustering techniques. I am also very interested in Big Data, and I used extensively the Oxford Advanced Research Computing facilities for one of my recent paper published in \href{http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/05/29/1718020115.short}{PNAS}. 

I think that I am an interesting candidate because of my double interest in social science (sociology) and in data science and my knowledge on how to combine the two.   

I am looking forward to hear from you. 
If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
